This tool when receiving an update will spool up and build a new container with the lastest code.

The purpose of this is to test Github Actions in order to set up CICD Pipelines through github, creating and deploying Docker Containers.

As of Right now, it will pull and build the Eve Online Database in order to consume private or publically.  This database though was never containerized.  That is where this comes in.

Enjoy.
